<p>Who is God?  Who is Yeshua?  Can a person know God and experience him personally?  People have asked these questions for thousands of years.  They are the questions this study hopes to answer.  If you have newly come to faith in Yeshua as the long-awaited Jewish messiah or if you are trying to learn more about God and Yeshua, this series will help you.</p>
<p>Please read these four lessons, then answer the questions at the end of each section. Each question is based on a Bible reference; to see the text for these references, simply mouse over them. (If you click on a Bible reference, a new window with expanded text will open). This study uses the New International Version (NIV) and English Standard Version (ESV) translations of the Bible but any recognized translation will work. If you have a Bible and prefer to use it, the table of contents will help you find the books of the Bible, then look for the chapter (the number to the left of the colon) and verse (to the right of the colon). For instance, John 3:16 means the third chapter and the sixteenth verse of the book of John.</p>
<p>The Bible is a large book made up of sixty-six smaller books written over a period of approximately 2000 years by about 40 different authors.  Almost all the authors in both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament were Jewish.  The first five books of the Bible were written by Moses and are known as the Torah.  These are followed by historical books, books of Hebrew poetry and books of sermons by some of the most famous Jewish prophets.  The New Testament portion of the Bible begins with 4 biographies of the life of Yeshua known as the Gospels. (Gospel means “good news.”)  The Gospels are followed by the book of Acts, a history of the early Jewish followers of Yeshua; 13 books by a Rabbi named Paul and then several smaller books written by other Jewish leaders from the Second Temple period.  It ends with the apocalyptic book of Revelation.</p>
<p>People of faith believe the Holy Spirit inspired the writers of the Bible so that the words they wrote were the exact words of God himself.  There are many proofs of the inspiration and inerrancy of the Scriptures.  Those proofs are for another study.  For the purpose of this study it is suggested that the student simply trust the Bible to be true. At least parts of the Bible have been with us for almost 4000 years.  No other book in the world has been attacked so bitterly as the Bible but still endures.  It has lasted so long because it is truth without any mixture of error.</p>
